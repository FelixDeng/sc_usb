This is the ECM example.

 - on Mac OS X: works out of the box, you should be able to direct your
   browser to http://blah.local/ or if that fails, try
   http://169.254.85.85/

 - on Linux: works out of the box but you need to install avahi in order
   for the name resolution to work (untested). You can direct your browser
   to http://169.254.85.85/

 - on Windows: we need to find a suitable driver.
